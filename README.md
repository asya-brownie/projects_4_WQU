# My projects

['World Quant University'](https://wqu.org/) provides free courses.
The Applied Data Science module is delivered entirely online so students can participate in continuing education without disrupting their lives.

**Scientific Computing and Python for Data Science**

In Unit I, students gain a comprehensive introduction to scientific computing, Python, and the related tools data scientists use to succeed in their work.

> What was covered during the Unit 1 : 
  - Program flow & data structures, algorithms, classes 
  - Data formats, Multi-dimensional arrays and vectorization in NumPy
  - DataFrame, Series, data ingestion and transformation with pandas,
  - Data aggregation in pandas, SQL and Object-Relational Mapping
  - Data munging


**Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis**

In Unit II, students develop machine learning and statistical analysis skills through hands-on practice with open-ended investigations of real-world data. Students can expect to work with authentic public data sets from organizations like the NHS, or anonymized data on credit card defaults. This unit has a heavy emphasis on creative use of the tools of data science to solve problems from multiple perspectives.


In this folder I publish my solutions of projects I covered during 8 weeks of classes for Unit 1, currently covering Unit 2.
